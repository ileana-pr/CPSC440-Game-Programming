// The object of the game is to defend your iceberg from dropping penguins by firing snowballs at them. You will use the left and right keys to aim, and the spacebar to fire. If enough penguins land on the iceberg, it will sink. The penguins will drop from the top of the screen, and you will need to fire at them before they reach the iceberg.
